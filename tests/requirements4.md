# Users should be able to offer a range of dates where their space is available.
    ## End user to use a simple calendar picker to enter a start and end date for each 'space'
    ## (Nice to have) - validation of non overlapping dates
    ### Class space/property
    #### Space name
    #### Space available date
    #### Scope - just one 'availability' slot to make implementation easier. (nice to have) Multiple availability slots.
