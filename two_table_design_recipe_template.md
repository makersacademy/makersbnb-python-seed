# Two Tables Design Recipe Template

_Copy this recipe template to design and create two related database tables from a specification._

## 1. Extract nouns from the user stories or specification

```
# EXAMPLE USER STORY:
# (analyse only the relevant part - here, the final line).

As a user I can register with email and password

As a user I can see the listings with 
property type, description, price, location and dates

As a user I can book an available property

```

```
Nouns:

email, password, properties, description, price
```

## 2. Infer the Table Name and Columns

Put the different nouns in this table. Replace the example with your own nouns.

| Record                | Properties          |
| --------------------- | ------------------  |
| users                 | email, password
| properties            | property_type, description, price, location, end_date start_date

1. Name of the first table (always plural): `users` 

    Column names: `email`, `password`

2. Name of the second table (always plural): `properties` 

    Column names: `property_type`, `description`, `price`, `location`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `available`

## 3. Decide the column types

[Here's a full documentation of PostgreSQL data types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html).

Most of the time, you'll need either `text`, `int`, `bigint`, `numeric`, or `boolean`. If you're in doubt, do some research or ask your peers.

Remember to **always** have the primary key `id` as a first column. Its type will always be `SERIAL`.

```
# EXAMPLE:

Table: users
id: SERIAL
email: text
password: text

Table: properties
id: SERIAL
property_type: text
description: text
price: int
location: text
start_date: date
end_date: date
available: boolean
```

## 4. Decide on The Tables Relationship

Most of the time, you'll be using a **one-to-many** relationship, and will need a **foreign key** on one of the two tables.

To decide on which one, answer these two questions:

1. Can one user have many properties? (Yes)
2. Can one property have many users? (No)

You'll then be able to say that:

1. **[users] has many [properties]**
2. And on the other side, **[property] belongs to [users]**
3. In that case, the foreign key is in the table [property]

Replace the relevant bits in this example with your own:

```
# EXAMPLE

1. Can one artist have many albums? YES
2. Can one album have many artists? NO

-> Therefore,
-> An artist HAS MANY albums
-> An album BELONGS TO an artist

-> Therefore, the foreign key is on the albums table.
```

*If you can answer YES to the two questions, you'll probably have to implement a Many-to-Many relationship, which is more complex and needs a third table (called a join table).*

## 5. Write the SQL

```sql
-- EXAMPLE
-- file: albums_table.sql

-- Replace the table name, columm names and types.

-- Create the table without the foreign key first.
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  email text,
  password text
);

-- Then the table with the foreign key second.
CREATE TABLE properties (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  property_type text,
  description text,
  price int,
  location text, 
  start_date date,
  end_date date,
  available boolean
-- The foreign key name is always {other_table_singular}_id
  user_id int,
  constraint fk_user foreign key(user_id)
    references users(id)
    on delete cascade
);


## 6. Create the tables

```bash
psql -h 127.0.0.1 database_name < albums_table.sql
```
