# Specification
```
Any signed-up user can list a new space.
Users can list multiple spaces.
Users should be able to name their space, provide a short description of the space, and a price per night.
Users should be able to offer a range of dates where their space is available.
Any signed-up user can request to hire any space for one night, and this should be approved by the user that owns that space.
Nights for which a space has already been booked should not be available for users to book that space.
Until a user has confirmed a booking request, that space can still be booked for that night.
