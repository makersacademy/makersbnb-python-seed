# {{PROBLEM}} Multi-Class Planned Design Recipe

## 1. Describe the Problem

_Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have._

## 2. Design the Class System

_Consider diagramming out the classes and their relationships. Take care to
focus on the details you see as important, not everything. The diagram below
uses asciiflow.com but you could also use excalidraw.com, draw.io, or miro.com_

```
┌────────────────────────────┐
│ MusicPlayer                │
│                            │
│ - tracks                   │
│ - add(track)               │
│ - search_by_title(keyword) │
│   => [tracks...]           │
└───────────┬────────────────┘
            │
            │ owns a list of
            ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Track(title, artist)    │
│                         │
│ - title                 │
│ - artist                │
│ - format()              │
│   => "TITLE by ARTIST"  │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

_Also design the interface of each class in more detail._

```

_Also design the interface of each class in more detail._

```python
class MusicLibrary:
    # User-facing properties:
    #   tracks: list of instances of Track

    def __init__(self):
        pass # No code here yet

    def add(self, track):
        # Parameters:
        #   track: an instance of Track
        # Side-effects:
        #   Adds the track to the tracks property of the self object
        pass # No code here yet

    def search_by_title(self, keyword):
        # Parameters:
        #   keyword: string
        # Returns:
        #   A list of the Track objects that have titles that include the keyword
        pass # No code here yet


class Track:
    # User-facing properties:
    #   title: string
    #   artist: string

    def __init__(self, title, artist):
        # Parameters:
        #   title: string
        #   artist: string
        # Side-effects:
        #   Sets the title and artist properties
        pass # No code here yet

    def format(self):
        # Returns:
        #   A string of the form "TITLE by ARTIST"
        pass # No code here yet

```
class User
<!-- Stores name/email/password -->


class UserRepository
<!-- db_connection -->
Create new user (Nice to have)
Login function (get and validate email and password)


class Space
<!-- Store and present name/description/price/available from and to/ UserID -->


class SpaceRepository
<!-- db_connection -->
Get all the spaces
Get user
Get availability dates
Get accepted bookings (to display available dates)?
Create a new space
Find by UserID

class Booking
<!-- Store and present SpaceID, UserID, Date, Status -->

class BookingRepository
<!-- db_connection -->
Request a booking
Confirm booking
Deny booking (automatic deny if date not available)
Get all bookings
Get my requests (view all made requests)
See requests made by user (UserID)
See requests made on a listing (SpaceID - cycle through booking and find ones associated with spaceID)



## 3. Create Examples as Integration Tests

_Create examples of the classes being used together in different situations and
combinations that reflect the ways in which the system will be used._

```python
# EXAMPLE

"""
Given a library
When we add two tracks
We see those tracks reflected in the tracks list
"""
library = MusicLibrary()
track_1 = Track("Carte Blanche", "Veracocha")
track_2 = Track("Synaesthesia", "The Thrillseekers")
library.add(track_1)
library.add(track_2)
library.tracks # => [track_1, track_2]
```

## 4. Create Examples as Unit Tests

_Create examples, where appropriate, of the behaviour of each relevant class at
a more granular level of detail._

```python
# EXAMPLE

"""
Given a track with a title and an artist
We see the title reflected in the title property
"""
track = Track("Carte Blanche", "Veracocha")
track.title # => "Carte Blanche"
```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 5. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green,
refactor to implement the behaviour._
